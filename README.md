# Coding Forum PHP Project

The Coding Forum PHP Project is a web application that simulates a coding forum, similar to StackOverflow. This project allows users to post coding-related queries and receive answers from the community. Users can also interact by commenting on queries and answers. The application includes user authentication to ensure secure access and participation.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**: The project includes a user authentication system, allowing users to create accounts, log in, and log out securely. This ensures that only registered users can post queries, answers, and comments.

2. **Post Queries**: Registered users can create new coding-related queries. Each query includes a title, a detailed description, and optional tags to categorize the question's topic.

3. **Answer Queries**: Users can provide answers to existing queries. This helps build a collaborative environment where the community can share their expertise and knowledge.

4. **Comment System**: Users can comment on both queries and answers. This encourages discussion, clarification, and further interaction among users.


## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: The project is built using PHP, a server-side scripting language, for handling backend logic.

- **MySQL**: MySQL is used as the database management system to store user accounts, queries, answers, and comments.

- **HTML/CSS**: HTML is used for structuring the web pages, and CSS is used for styling to create an appealing and user-friendly interface.

- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is used to enhance the user experience, enable dynamic interactions, and handle client-side validation.

- **Bootstrap**: Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework, is utilized to ensure responsive design and consistent styling across different devices.
